# WatchTower

A real-time neighborhood safety platform where neighbors report and track local incidents — open garage doors, unattended packages, lost pets, vandalism, suspicious activity, and safe-walk requests. Built for communities to stay informed and look out for each other.

Website: watch-tower-app.vercel.app

## Features

- **Live incident feed** — Browse active, resolved, or all alerts filtered by your watch zones
- **Interactive live map** — Real-time map of active incidents with category-colored pins, coordinates on click, and one-tap resolve
- **File a report** — Two-step modal: pick a category, add details, capture GPS location (optional), and post to your zip code community
- **Watch zones** — Monitor any US zip code. Filter the feed and map to only show what matters to you
- **Neighbor karma** — Earn +10 karma for every report you file. Your score is saved with your account
- **Community verification** — Neighbors can verify reports and mark them as resolved
- **Comments & updates** — Threaded updates on each incident to coordinate with neighbors
- **Analytics dashboard** — Breakdown of reports by category and zip code
- **Real-time sync** — New reports, comments, and status changes appear instantly across all devices via Supabase Realtime
- **Optional accounts** — Use the app anonymously (browser-based) or sign up with email/password to save your profile across devices

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres + Realtime + Auth)
- **Icons:** Lucide React

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A Supabase project (or run the included migrations against your own)

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure

Create a `.env` file with your Supabase credentials:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Database

The schema and RLS policies are defined in `supabase/migrations/`. The app uses two identity paths:

- **Anonymous mode** — A browser-generated `client_id` (UUID) keys the user's profile, zones, and reports
- **Authenticated mode** — Email/password sign-up creates a `profiles` row keyed by `user_id` (Supabase Auth)

Both paths coexist via dual-path Row Level Security policies that check either `auth.uid() = user_id` or `client_id` match.

### Key tables

- `incidents` — Reports filed by neighbors (category, title, description, location, zip, status, verifications)
- `comments` — Threaded updates on incidents
- `watch_zones` — Zip codes a user monitors
- `profiles` — Display name and karma score
